# Emotion based music recommendation system
# About
The primary objective of our project is to design and implement an emotion recognition system that seamlessly integrates with existing music recommendation algorithms. We aspire to enhance the user experience by dynamically adjusting song recommendations based on the real-time analysis of facial expressions. The scope of our project encompasses the development of a robust and efficient system capable of accurately identifying a spectrum of emotions and translating this understanding into tailored music suggestions.
